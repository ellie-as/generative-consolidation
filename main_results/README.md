### Consolidation simulations

Code for modelling consolidation as teacher-student learning, in which initial representations of memories are replayed to train a generative model.

There are four notebooks:
* **Consolidation_simulation.ipynb**: Models the end-to-end process of consolidation with four datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and greyscale versions of Shapes3D and symmetric_solids. See https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview for further information about each dataset.
* **Memory_distortions.ipynb**: Models the results of Carmichael (1932).
* **Hybrid_recall.ipynb**: Models how both the teacher and student network could contribute to recall of a partially consolidated memory.
* **Novelty_and_consolidation.ipynb**: Models how novelty may affect memory processing.
